							<h4>CSS At 16</h4>
							<p>Although it sounds silly, being a teenage girl really prepared me for both of my successful, adult careers. I spent many years
								as a recruiter, where the talking on the phone and stalking people online I'd done as a teenager made me a natural. I also was always
								the one figuring out how to jailbreak a friends copy of the Sims, or change the css for our various social media layouts. I never
								knew at the time that my technical aptitude meant anything, and I imagined technical careers as tedious, and not creative. I was very
								wrong where that was concerned.<br/></p>

						<h4>Recruiting</h4>
						<p>In 2010 I began my career as a recruiter in Finance. Two years later, I happened into technology and the rest is history. Recruiting
						is a great field for young professionals - it allows you to vicariously sample other careers if you haven't settled on your own
						path yet. In my case, doing high tech work, it exposed me to niche COTS and GOTS software applications and boutique cybersecurity
						solutions for alphabet soup big wigs like the DIA, DISA, US Air Force, the Pentagon, NGA, etc. </p>
						<p> While technically in the HR business unit, my sucess recruiting was entirely based on the fact that I found technology interesting
					  and could get a lot more granular with technical professionals than the average joe. I also snuck into all the corporate certification
						courses I could, learning project management and IT Service management methodologies. I also became certified in advanced boolean
						techniques - not knowing I'd later use my skill at boolean manipulation to write code and query databases.</p><br/>
						<h4>Decision Time</h4>
						<p>In May 2016 I took a pretty big risk towards changing my life and career. At this point the amount of technical knowledge I had
						was really squandered in a career recruiting. After doing some research, I made two decisions: one, to enter a four month immersive
						bootcamp program through General Assembly. And two: after that, to pursue a MIS degree. (Still working on part two.)</p>
						<p>In addition to taking a huge risk and leaving a career where I was well established, I decided that moving from the expensive DC region
						also had to be part of my plan. Realizing I would hit the reset button and start my career programming as 'entry level', I wanted an
						affordable city where any financial impact would be minimized. After doing some research, Raleigh it was. (And I ended up loving it here!)</p><br/>
						<h4>'Bootcamp' Was Right</h4>
						<p> I am not going to be one of those people who tell you how much fun bootcamps are. I signed up for one in the midst of my 300+ mile move to
						Raleigh, which was beyond exhausting. It was also the first course of its type done remotely, and implementing the curriculum was bumpy at times.</p>
						<p> The main takeaways any bootcamp grad should have are simple. One: you don't learn languages, you learn how to think. You learn how to LEARN, like a
							crazy person a little. Programming languages have more
					  commonality than differences. You learn the patterns, you learn problem solving on steroids, and you realize wherever you end up working you'll be fine
            with whatever tech stack they have. Two: You become addicted to programming, if you are doing it right. You are jazzed to be in a cool career, you are
						jazzed to have survived. But even if you ended up resigned to a career in some other field you would tend to your addiction, and keep building things
						just because.</p>
						<p>There are also things you unlearn. As a recruiter, I always put developers on a pedestal because a) the job sounded insane, b) many have egos that seem to
						suggest they all must be geniuses, and c) the workforce courts them like semi-royalty. After becoming a programmer myself, I realize how incredibly wrong those
						assumptions were. Maybe people that want adoration sometimes get drawn into the field to get to walk around acting cocky all day. But learning programming, how
						frustrating it is and how vast the litany of things you can learn is, you should only be humbled. Anything else is a red flag, in prospective hires, coworkers,
						friends, whatever. </p><br/>
						<h4>The Job Hunt</h4>
						<p> There are people from the bootcamp program I did who still aren't working yet, but they are in the minority. Also about a quarter of our class couldn't complete the course.
							It didn't follow best to worst
							programming skills in order of who got their programming gigs first. I'm sure I benefitted a bit unfairly by knowing recruiting processes inside and out,
							but it still took me some time. (Just shy of three months.) </p>
						<p>I wasn't the most gung-ho bootcamp student. Sometimes the workload would be so crazy I would just say "NOPE. I'm going to sleep." while others stayed up
							to the point of exhaustion. But I was a maniac from the second I graduated. I applied to over three hundred jobs, at least 1/4 of them going through the
							process of writing a very personalized cover letter, etc. I went on probably around 20 interviews, and did turn down some opportunities.</p>
						<p> I also at long last caught up on sleep after the bootcamp and move, and apparently being rested makes programming way more intuitive for me. Without
							instructors or any taskmasters I started keeping a brutal schedule: 40 hours a week jobhunting, no exaggeration. Three hours of coding practice on my own
							every evening. And every weekend I tried a new tutorial or to churn a new app out with Ruby or some of the things I felt more steady handed with. The things
							I studied that I didn't learn from bootcamp include PHP, Wordpress, SQL, Java, React, Angular, Python, and Sass/Less. I also continued doing another part
							time JavaScript course through General Assembly that covered basic JSON as well as jQuery.</p>
						 <p> Part of the reason I think I did prevail in finding a job quicker than some of my peers is from all of these behaviors combined, I went from solidly
							 'middle of the pack' (compared to all the people in my bootcamp course) to having more experience than some of the class wunderkinds. Not because I was the smartest, or most intuitive learner
							 of technical stuff, but because I literally recreated the 'immersive' experience from bootcamp and put myself through it for an additional three months.
							 Heck, I'm still doing it. I'm sitting here on a beautiful Sunday and alternating running errands with building a new portfolio even though I have a perfectly
							 good one already. I still come home from work and jump right back into tutorials in my free time.</p><br/>
							 <h4>The First Gig</h4>
							 <p>For the past couple of months, I've been working at a prominent non profit research institute here in Raleigh. Through pure luck I ended up
								 having a commute that tops out at 15 minutes. (Most days I run home at lunch to let my puppies out and get back to work with time to spare.) My boss is
								 very transparent, relaxed, and supportive. My coworkers are entertaining, well informed, and all-around wonderful.</p>
							 <p>My favorite thing is getting to work early. RTI (My work) is housed in a sprawling campus called Research Triangle Park, surrounded by tall pines. Each morning
								 I walk towards the staid building I work in, which is entirely unglamorous, and feel how Harry Potter must have felt returning to Hogwarts each year. I guess
								 what made me originally think of that metaphor (which isn't terribly creative, I admit) I had the thought that it feels like I get to go to work and do magic
								 every day.</p>
							 <p> General Assembly is opening a Raleigh campus, and I've offered to dust off my recruiting networking skills to facilitate a warm welcome for their Raleigh
								 campus. And so far at work, I haven't struggled technically to do anything I've been asked, despite my quite untraditional background.</p>
